# Unittest_Automation
# 
# This script automatically generates a new test file with Unittests for all of the functions in a script that you specify after running the script.  This is intended to save time typing it up manually.
# 
# It will create a new file, and will setup Unittests for each of the functions in the script you specify.  The new file will be named with the original file name prepended with "test_".
# 
# Sample output:
#  What is the Python file's name (with extension)?  script.py
#  File 'test_script.py' created.
# 
# Please let me know if you have any issues or suggestions for improvement.
